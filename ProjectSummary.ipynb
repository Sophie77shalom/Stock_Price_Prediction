    "ðŸ“Œ **Title:** Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Forecasting  \n",
    "ðŸ“Œ **Presented By:** Sophy Jeptoo  \n",
    "ðŸ“Œ **Objective:**\n",
    "- To develop a predictive analytics model for stock price forecasting.\n",
    "- To provide insights for better investment decisions and risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Matters for Akira?**\n",
    "ðŸ“Š **Business Relevance**  \n",
    "- Akira is building a **tech-first investment platform** for Kenyan investors.\n",
    "- Investors need **data-driven insights** to track and automate portfolio decisions.\n",
    "- This project enhances **risk scoring, forecasting, and decision automation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸš€ **How This Helps Akira:**\n",
    "- **Better Risk Management:** Predictive analytics enables **scenario-based forecasting** (best, worst, base-case scenarios).\n",
    "- **Smarter Decision-Making:** Helps investors **identify market trends** and optimize investment strategies.\n",
    "- **Automation & Alerts:** Can trigger notifications (e.g., **\"Alert me if Safaricom stock drops 5%\"**).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Overview**\n",
    "ðŸ“‚ **Source:** NSE historical stock prices dataset (e.g., Safaricom, Equity Bank)\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Š **Key Columns:**\n",
    "- **Date** â€“ The trading date.\n",
    "- **Open, High, Low, Close** â€“ Daily stock price movements.\n",
    "- **Volume** â€“ Number of shares traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ›  **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "- Cleaned missing values.\n",
    "- Converted **Date** to a DateTime index.\n",
    "- Standardized column names for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "ðŸ“Š **Key Insights from the Data:**\n",
    "- **Trend Analysis:** Is the stock price increasing or decreasing over time?\n",
    "- **Seasonality:** Are there repeating patterns in stock movements?\n",
    "- **Moving Averages:** Helps smooth out short-term fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“ˆ **Visuals:**\n",
    "- Stock price trend over time.\n",
    "- Daily trading volume variations.\n",

    "### **Predictive Models Used**\n",
    "ðŸ”® **1. Exponential Smoothing (Holtâ€™s Method)**\n",
    "   - Best for **short-term forecasting**.\n",
    "   - Captures trends but **not complex seasonality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”® **2. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**\n",
    "   - A statistical model that captures **trends and seasonality**.\n",
    "   - Works well for time series data with **consistent patterns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”® **3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory - Deep Learning)**\n",
    "   - A **neural network-based model** that learns long-term dependencies.\n",
    "   - Best for handling **non-linear patterns** in stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Evaluation & Selection**\n",
    "ðŸ“Š **Comparison of Models Based on Accuracy:**\n",
    "| Model         | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) |\n",
    "|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| Exponential Smoothing | X.XX | X.XX |\n",
